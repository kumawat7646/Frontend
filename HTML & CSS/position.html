    <!-- 5 types of POsition :

        1 static -> default position of any div
        2 relative -> it can move anywhere you want but form his position but it can'nt left his orignal position, his orignal position always kept that position as a blank space 
        3 absolute -> leave his position, and it can move anywhere from the parent position not from his old position...and if a div-box is in     a div-container and we applied absolute in box then that box work on the screen-parent and if we want to work as a container-parent then we have to applied position-relative in container
        4 fixed -> it also left his position but when you apply his position, he always fixed there you scroll the site his position remain fixed on screen  
        5 stickey -> in this positon....like we adjust his position on the bottom and when we scroll down it moves to upward and when it connect to top-screen then he stickes like chipak jaaega  upar top of the screen pe and jb apn down scroll then he set on the orignal position
